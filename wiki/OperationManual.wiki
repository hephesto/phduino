= Introduction =

This document describes how to power it up and control it.

= Power up and control =

The pHduino can be operated powered by an external power supply from 9V up to 12V or by USB cable.

You don´t need the LCD if you are using the pHduino connect to a USB port. The results can be showed and saved using a terminal serial program. Suggestions:

=== for Windows ===

  * Hyperterminal
  * Realterm [http://realterm.sourceforge.net/ http://realterm.sourceforge.net/]
  * Terminalbpp [https://sites.google.com/site/terminalbpp/ https://sites.google.com/site/terminalbpp/]

=== for GNU/Linux ===

  * Cutecom [http://cutecom.sourceforge.net/ http://cutecom.sourceforge.net/]
  * gtkterm [http://gtkterm.feige.net/ http://gtkterm.feige.net/]

=== for MacOSX ===

  * screen command line. Example: screen /dev/tty.usbserial 9600

== Temperature sensor ==

*WARNING*: Don´t sock the temperature sensor LM35 in the solution without a water proof case! The suggestion is tape it outside of the bottle.

You can operate the pHduino without a LM35 sensor. In this case, you need use the commands:

cmd set_temp_sensor on|off
cmd set_temp FLOAT

Obs.: Replace on|off by on or off and the FLOAT word by a floating point number (celcius degree).

= LCD Informations =

When the pHduino is powered up, it shows the project name and the firmware version. Just after, the firmware starts to show the measurements.

There are four informations on display.

|| temperature / celsius degree || pH from 0 to 14 ||
|| pH sensor voltage / mV || ADC value from 0 to 830 ||

The date are sent continuously by USB port in a string. The fields are separated by spaces and the line is ended with \r\n (Serial.println() function from Arduino).

= Calibration =

To calibrate a pH meter you need two buffer solutions. Select the buffer solutions depending on the pH range that you will work. This procedure considers that you pH sensor is linear in the working range: from 1 or 2 to 10 or 12 typically. Without this range the glass electrode has deviation. 

  * Acid or neutral solutions: pH 4 and 7 buffers.
  * Alkaline solutions: pH 7 and 9 or 10 buffers.

Pay attention that you can find buffer solutions with values a little bit different. Example of buffer values for pH meter calibration are 4.01, 6,86, 7.01, 9.18, 10.01, and etc. What is important is to know the correct buffer value.

You can buy bottles or sachets of ready to use buffer solutions or buy sachets of poured buffer to mix with distillated water. Buffer solutions must be maintained in a refrigerator (*don´t mix with food!*) and they have a life time (they can develop fungus or bacterias).

= Calibration Procedure =

*WARNING*: Take care with the glass bubble. It is fragile.

== Calibration for acid or neutral range ==

  * Adjust the gain trimpot to an intermediate value.
  * Remove the glass electrode protection.
  * Wash the electrode with distillated water and dry it using a soft paper carefully.
  * Put the pH sensor inside of pH 7 solution (remember that can be the pH 6.86 o 7.01).
  * Wait for the stabilization of the signal.
  * Adjust the offset trimpot to the nominal buffer value.
  * Wash the electrode with distillated water and dry it using a soft paper carefully.
  * Put the pH sensor inside of pH 4 solution (remember that can be the pH 4.01).
  * Wait for the stabilization of the signal.
  * Adjust the gain trimpot to the nominal buffer value.
  * Wash the electrode with distillated water and dry it using a soft paper carefully.

== Calibration for alkaline range ==

  * Adjust the gain trimpot to an intermediate value.
  * Remove the glass electrode protection.
  * Wash the electrode with distillated water and dry it using a soft paper carefully.
  * Put the pH sensor inside of pH 7 solution (remember that can be the pH 6.86 o 7.01).
  * Wait for the stabilization of the signal.
  * Adjust the offset trimpot to the nominal buffer value.
  * Wash the electrode with distillated water and dry it using a soft paper carefully.
  * Put the pH sensor inside of pH 9 solution (remember that can be the pH 9.18 or 10.01).
  * Wait for the stabilization of the signal.
  * Adjust the gain trimpot to the nominal buffer value.
  * Wash the electrode with distillated water and dry it using a soft paper carefully.

The pH sensor is ready to use. To read the pH of your sample, put it inside of the sample and wait for stabilization of the signal. Always wash it and dry it carefully to avoid contamination when you change the samples.

After the use, wash it and dry it with a piece of soft paper carefully, and keep it in water solution to avoid dehydration of the glass bubble and the reference electrode porous ions channel.
